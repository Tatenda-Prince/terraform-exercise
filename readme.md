# Terraform Exercise

## Introduction

Having a robust and reliable cloud infrastructure is crucial for businesses to deliver seamless services to their customers. High availability and fault tolerance are two essential components of such an infrastructure. 

In order to achieve this, many organizations turn to infrastructure automation tools like Terraform to deploy and manage their cloud resources.

We’ll explore how to use Terraform to deploy a high availability and fault-tolerant cloud environment on AWS, complete with an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) spanning two Availability Zones in private subnets of a custom VPC. 

We’ll also look at how to front the ASG with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) placed in public subnets, with appropriate gateway and route table configurations.

By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to leverage Terraform to build a reliable and scalable cloud infrastructure that can handle high traffic loads and maintain uptime, even in the event of failures in individual components.


## What is Terraform

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows developers to define and manage cloud infrastructure resources in a declarative way.

Declarative is a programming concept where a program describes what should be accomplished, rather than how to accomplish it. In the context of Terraform, a declarative approach means that you define the desired state of your infrastructure and Terraform takes care of figuring out the necessary actions to achieve that state.

In Terraform, you define the desired state of your infrastructure using a configuration file, which specifies the resources you want to create, their properties and any dependencies between them. You do not need to write procedural code that specifies how to create and manage those resources. Instead, Terraform compares the desired state with the current state of the infrastructure and determines the necessary actions to achieve the desired state.

Terraform is also cloud agnostic. This means it supports multiple cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), as well as various other services, such as databases, DNS, and monitoring tools.

## Benefits of using Terraform

1.*Infrastructure as code*: Terraform provides a way to define infrastructure as code, which means you can version control and manage your infrastructure just like you would with application code.

2.*Reusability*: Terraform allows you to reuse infrastructure code across different environments, making it easier to manage and deploy consistent infrastructure.

3.*Cloud-agnostic*: Terraform can manage resources across multiple cloud providers and services, making it a great tool for multi-cloud deployments.

4.*Consistency*: Terraform ensures that the infrastructure deployed is consistent across all environments, making it easier to manage and maintain.

Now let me give you some background information to understand the more specific components of Terraform.
